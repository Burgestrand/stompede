Stompede is a Pub/Sub server which implements the [STOMP](http://stomp.github.io/)
protocol. It is written in Ruby, on top of [Celluloid](http://celluloid.io/).

Clients can subscribe to multiple destinations and send and receive messages.
STOMP is a transport agnostic protocol, and Stompede comes with a TCP server as
well as a WebSocket server.

The WebSocket server enables browsers to subscribe to multiple destinations
over a single WebSocket connection, greatly reducing the number of open socket
connections.

### Usage

Stompede apps are written by inheriting from `Stompede::Stomplet`:

``` ruby
class MyStomplet < Stompede::Stomplet
  def on_open
    # called when the socket is opened
  end

  def on_connect(frame)
    # called when the client sends a CONNECT frame
  end

  def on_subscribe(subscription, frame)
    # called when the client sends a SUBSCRIBE frame
  end

  def on_send(frame)
    # called when the client sends a SEND frame
  end

  def on_unsubscribe(subscription, frame)
    # called when the client sends a UNSUBSCRIBE frame
  end

  def on_disconnect(frame)
    # called when the client sends a DISCONNECT frame
  end

  def on_close
    # called when the socket is closed
  end
end
```

It can then be served up via:

``` ruby
Stompede::TCPServer.new(MyStomplet).listen("127.0.0.1", 8675)
```

Or to start a WebSocket server using [Reel](https://github.com/celluloid/reel):

``` ruby
Stompede::WebSocketServer.new(MyStomplet).listen("127.0.0.1", 8675)
```

You can also hook Stompede into an existing server by creating a connector and
feeding it socket connections:

``` ruby
connector = Stompede::Connector.new(MyStomplet)
connector.async.connect(socket)
```

In all cases Stompede will create an instance of `MyStomplet` for each active
socket connection.

### Celluloid

`Stompede::Stomplet` is a Celluloid actor. That means it creates a new thread
for each socket connection. This means you won't have to worry about
thread-safety, and you can take advantage of all of Celluloid's features, like
linking and pipelining.

Stomplets run in ATOM mode by default, but it is safe to run them in exclusive
mode if you want. See the celluloid documentation about [execution
modes](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid/wiki/Pipelining-and-execution-modes)
for more details.

### Lifecycle callbacks

`on_open` and `on_close` are always called when the socket is opened and when
it is closed. These callbacks are dependable, and you can rely on Stompede
always calling them.

`on_connect` and `on_disconnect` are called when the client sends the `CONNECT`
and `DISCONNECT` frames respectively. Misbehaving clients may not do so. Also
network errors or sudden closing of the socket may cause even well behaved
clients not to call these handlers. Especially, do not rely on the
`on_disconnect` handler to clean up any resources allocated for the client, use
`on_close` instead. They are still useful in that clients may provide headers
with the frames, for example for authentication.

### Subscriptions

`on_subscribe` receives a subscription object, on which `message` may be called,
in order to send message to the client. For example:

``` ruby
class MyStomplet < Stompede::Stomplet
  def on_subscribe(subscription, frame)
    @pinger = every(1) do
      subscription.message("PONG", pong: "yes")
    end
  end

  def on_unsubscribe(subscription, frame)
    @pinger.cancel
  end
end
```

This example also shows how you can use Celluloid timers. Stompede supports the
`heart-beat` header in the STOMP protocol, so this kind of pinging is probably
not necessary.

Stompede guarantees that `on_unsubscribe` will always be called even in the
event of the socket suddently closing for any reason.

The STOMP protocol requires that a client must have subscribed before the
server can send messages to the client, and that messages must be tied to a
subscription, this is why it is not possible to send messages to a client
without a valid subscription.

### Messaging everyone

You can send a message to everyone who subscribes to a given destination. You can
do this by using `message_all` on the session object within your Stomplet. For
example:

``` ruby
class BridgeStomplet < Stompede::Stomplet
  def on_send(frame)
    session.message_all(frame.destination, frame.body)
  end
end
```

This simple Stomplet will act as a bridge, proxying SEND frames the client
sends to all subscribers of the frame's destination. The `message_all` method
is also available on servers and connectors:

``` ruby
server = Stompede::WebSocketServer.new(MyStomplet)
server.listen("127.0.0.1", 8675)
# ... later ...
server.message_all("some_destination", "Hello!")
```

### Heartbeats

Heartbeats allow you to make sure that idle clients are promptly disconnected.
If you want your server to send or receive heartbeats, specify them like this:

``` ruby
Stompede::TCPServer.new(MyStomplet, heart_beats: [20, 50])
```

The first number specifies how often the client should send heart beats and the
second number specifies how often the server sends heart beats. Both values are
in seconds (note that the STOMP spec uses milliseconds).

The STOMP spec allows the client to override the heartbeat setting, and essentially
opt out of having to send heart beats. This works fine if you trust your clients,
but if clients are untrusted, you might want to force them to send hearbeats. Stompede
has a special option for this:

``` ruby
Stompede::TCPServer.new(MyStomplet, heart_beats: [20, 50], require_heart_beats: true)
```

### Connect timeout

Compliant clients should send a `CONNECT` or `STOMP` frame shortly after
opening a socket connection. This allows you to do authentication, and to set
up heart beats. Malicious clients might open a lot of socket connections, but
never actually send a `CONNECT` frame. By default, Stompede closes the
connection if the client has not sent a `CONNECT` frame within 10 seconds. If
you want to change this timeout, you can use the `connect_timeout` config
option to the desired number of seconds:

``` ruby
Stompede::TCPServer.new(MyStomplet, connect_timeout: 120)
```

Set it to `nil` to disable the connect timeout entirely.

### Receipts

The STOMP protocol allows clients to request receipts when sending messages to
the server. They do this by specifying the `receipt` header in the frame
they're sending. The Server then responds with a `RECEIPT` frame when the
request has finished processing.

Stompede automatically sends receipts when the client asks for them. In the
case that the callback handler returns without raising any errors, a receipt
will be sent, if the handler raises an error, an `ERROR` frame is sent instead,
and the connection is closed.

There may be situations where you want more granular control over when a
receipt is sent. For example, you might want to perform some processing
asynchronously:

``` ruby
class MyStomplet < Stompede::Stomplet
  class Worker
    include Celluloid

    def do_work(frame)
      # ... do heavy work
      frame.receipt
    rescue => e
      frame.error(e)
      raise
    end
  end

  def initialize
    @worker = Worker.new_link
  end

  def on_send(frame)
    frame.detach! # don't send an automatic receipt
    @worker.async.do_work(frame)
  end
end
```

The call to `frame.detach!` tells Stompede not to automatically send a receipt.
You then need to manually send a receipt by calling `frame.receipt` or
`frame.error`. These methods are thread-safe, so you can call them from
another actor.

### The ack header, ACK and NACK

When the client establishes a subscription, they can send along a special `ack`
header, which can be one of `auto` (the default), `client` and
`client-individual`. The STOMP spec [defines what these mean](http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html#SUBSCRIBE_ack_Header).

If the ack mode of a subscription isn't `auto`, calling `message` blocks until
the client sends either an `ACK` or `NACK` frame and then returns this frame.
Other than this, Stompede does not attach any semantics to acks. If you want
to retry in case of a `NACK` or do something in case of an `ACK` you will need
to implement this yourself.

Stompede does provide the `message!` method which also blocks until the client
sends `ACK` or `NACK`, but unlike `message`, it raises an exception when the
client sends a `NACK` frame.

The STOMP spec allows clients to decide for themselves which ack mode they want
for any given subscription. If you do not trust your clients to make this call,
you should raise an error in your `on_subscribe` handler. For example:

``` ruby
class MyStomplet < Stompede::Stomplet
  def on_subscribe(subscription, frame)
    unless subscription.ack_mode == :client_individual
      raise Stompede::ClientError, "must ack all messages"
    end
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Handling global state

Each Stomplet is a Celluloid actor, which means you can use Celluloid's regular
primitives to share state between them. For example, if you want to add a
counter which counts the number of sends:

``` ruby
class Counter
  include Celluloid

  attr_reader :count

  def initialize
    @count = 0
  end

  def mark
    @count += 1
  end
end

Counter.supervise_as(:counter)

class MyStomplet < Stompede::Stomplet
  def initialize(session)
    super(session)
    @counter = link(Actor[:counter])
  end

  def on_send(frame)
    @counter.mark
  end
end
```

Since the two actors are linked, that means that if `Counter` crashes, it will
take all instances of `MyStomplet` with it. This is probably what you want
(since you cannot rely on its state anymore), but be careful.

### ROFLscale with LightStomplet

*Note: this doesn't fully work yet*

Since Stomplets are Celluloid actors, you end up using one thread for each open
socket. Don't worry, this is most likely fine. Celluloid can also use Ruby's
fibers for concurrency, which are more light weight and don't have any system
limits imposed on them. This allows you to push Stompede further than using
Threads.

If you inherit from `Stompede::LightStomplet` instead of `Stompede::Stomplet`,
your stomplets are not Celluloid actors. This is considerably less convenient
than the regular `Stomplet` class, since you cannot use Celluloid's awesome
features.

Since the Stompede dispatcher calls into your Stomplets, and it is a singleton,
this means that your Stomplet is also single threaded. You should in other
words not do any blocking IO, CPU intensive tasks in it, and you should
definitely *not* wait for ACKs from the client, as this will lead to deadlocks.

To fix this, you can either make sure your Stomplet never does something which
blocks, or you can add workers to the dispatcher:

``` ruby
class MyStomplet < Stompede::LightStomplet
end

Stompede::TCPServer.new(MyStomplet, workers: 40)
```

This will spawn a pool of 40 workers which handle callbacks to your
application. This means that callbacks on your Stomplet may be called from
multiple separate threads, which means your Stomplet must be threadsafe.
